What is the worst use of a book you've ever seen?

I cannot answer for myself, but instead for my teacher when I was in class 4A at my primary school in 1958/59.

I was always a bookish child even at the age of ten, and as compliant with rules as I knew how to be. A ‘good boy’. We were making calendars in class, part of the process of which was to get an oblong of cardboard, cover it with some such medium as wallpaper and then stick a decorative picture of some kind to that.

My inspiration was to get out of my desk a copy of the Bible, a weighty tome, and to use it to press down on the budding artwork to get a better adhesion and remove any nascent air bubbles. Upon seeing this my teacher, a kindly man who was a prominent lay preacher, said in the most abrupt manner, ‘Stop that! I've never seen such a use for a Bible!’

Even as an innocent child I reflected that he must have had a very uneventful life thus far.

So, as a lifelong bibliophile and voracious consumer of books to this day, who views any ill-treatment of books with abhorrence, I still think he was wrong!

If I were to follow the lead of what I consider very foolish fellows on Quora I could end with ‘What do you think of that?’

But I won’t.
This next one is the worst incident I can think of not just because of what was done to a book, but because of the tragic consequences beyond that of the sheer stupidity of the two people who got this idea.

About two years ago, this couple decided to repeat that stunt where you fire a gun through a book and see how deep the bullet goes. If I remember correctly, they used a hardcover Encyclopedia. Why? For Youtube views.

Narcissism aside, that kind of thing severely irritates the crap out of me. Of course, that’s not even the worst of it. 
The worst of it is this: The pistol they selected? .50cal Desert Eagle. The range they fired from? Less than a couple of feet IIRC, so basically point-blank. It gets worse: He held the Encyclopedia to his chest.

I don’t think I need to explain what happens next when a bullet that big starts moving that fast(the muzzle velocity of a .50 AE round from a Desert Eagle is 470 m/s IIRC) across that kind of range with nothing in between it and a human body except a few inches of paper and cardboard.
The second worst use I've seen is people being more concerned with how the book looks than the enjoyment of it. Get lost in the story, read it whilst traveling, read it in the bath, fall asleep on it because you wanted to read “Just one more chapter”. Anything. Anything except getting pissy about a creased corner. How can you get lost in a book if you're always alert about being careful.

I buy most of my books second hand because I love seeing a book that was thoroughly enjoyed. Like the wrinkled face of someone who's lived life, a creased book tells it's own story apart from the words that are printed on it's pages.

The absolutely worst use though is no use at all.
Never seen anyone use a book in a way it wasn’t intended to be used for. But I can imagine a few things.

You can burn the book in order to survive, not the worse thing to do. In a situation like that, it’ll be worse if you use the book the way it was designed to be used.

You can use it as a adult toy. Someone, somewhere is probably doing that as I’m answering this question. And I’m sure that they are getting paper cuts in the process.

You can use it to hide stuff by cutting out a large amount of pages, leaving the edges there and gluing them. Something that is actually cool if you have a book in very poor condition.

Using a book as a weapon. Maybe hit someone in the face and say that you wanted to know if facebooking someone was a good idea (sure that this question will be seen on Facebook).
