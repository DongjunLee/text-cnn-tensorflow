What are the books you never liked but are heavily recommended by most people?
The books that make reading feel like a chore, or the books that don’t make me want to pick up where I left them, I don’t like them.

After reading this question, a fair share of books came to my mind. However, I will talk about a book that came out recently and before I could get my hands on it, it was an epidemic.

The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck by Mark Manson
I have seen people treat this book as the new bible. It’s like this book is the only solution to their lives’ problems. There is nothing that can stop them from having a happy & a healthy life after they complete this book!

I found it to be overrated. I cannot stress enough how boring and repetitive that book was to me. 
Mark Manson writes kickass and to-the-point blogs, but this book? It was like a one-page blog stretched into a 200-page novel!
The funniest thing I found was that the author was talking about not giving a f*ck while this entire time he did give a f*ck about people who gave a f*ck. Confusing, much?

I really wanted to know how to not care about the trivial things in life, but I could do a lot more with reasons and plan-of-action rather than just screaming, ‘I don’t give a f*ck!’ every time a problem realizes in my head.

Anyway, one of the biggest reasons why this book didn’t work for me was that none of the things the author said, stayed with me. 
There was nothing new under the sun and I felt like the author is screaming on me till I cave and not give a f*ck.

I’m personally not a fan of tough-love or “Because I say so” theories, which is why I won’t recommend it further.
I  have heard this a multiple number of times from people, professors, geeks, aliens, frankensteins and whoever not…

But frankly, people, I don’t think that Let Us C has ever been a good book for beginners. No offence to the writer(s), even a programming noob can clearly see the number of mistakes in the book. If you recall these type of mistakes were once termed as silly mistakes, and often you got scolded on by your mother for not paying any attention to studies.

I have seen beginners completely confused about programming, leave aside C, after going through this book, think it as a gospel.

Apart from the mistakes, I personally find the content very unorganized and not at all structured. Rather than nurturing your mind for learning C, it will totally confuse you, and you will end up fearing C, as if it is some alien tongue.

There are some really good books available for learning C, even if it looks intimidating, it is better than Let Us C any day. 
Or else if you are very lazy, look for online tutorials for C on sites like javatpoint, tutorialspoint or even youtube. That will help.
I did a lot of Research for finding these best books and make a collection of them into a single App. Everyone should try once and if possible then share with others for someone's Life..!! Thank you.

The Bhagavad Gita

I am not promoting Hinduism, But I want to share the True and Genuine Meaning of The Bhagavad Gita and How it will influence your perspective about the Life, Life Events and What after the Life..! Take it as Positive. Thanks..!

The way How to live life !

The Solution of Every Problems !

The meaning of life !

The Song of God Krishna !

The Guide of God for Mankind !

Actually, The Role of Arjuna in The Gita was of a common person who has lots of questions in mind about what to do and don't in any situations that should be faced by everyone in his/her entire journey of the life. God Krishna tries to address all the possible questions or problems or thoughts that arise in everyone's life.

The Gita is the guide in which you will find all the Answers of your questions, Problems or queries, You just need to understand The Meaning of Gita as per your situation. That's the actual way to understand the Gita.

God Krishna is the Teacher of the whole Universe. The Gita is the available guide for mankind. He tries to teach you what is life, the purpose of the life and what afterlife through the Gita…
