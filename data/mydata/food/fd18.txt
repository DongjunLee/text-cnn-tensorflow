I have covered major items, still there are many like Jowar Roti, Mangalore Buns, etc.

But I will end here. If any one is visiting Bangalore please visit MTR Hotels, and VV. Puram at evenings for authentic Karnataka and south Indian food.

And at last a cup of pure filter coffee

What are options, people already written in their wonderful answers.

I can tell you about typical north indian middle class breakfasts.

Most people are vegetarians so egg and meat avoided.

During childhood we usually eat

1.Mostly Plain Parantha(some time stuffed) with glass of milk.


( glass of milk replaced by cup of tea.

2. Boiled and fried Black gram.


3. Suji ka halwa.


4. Jalebi from market.


5.Chole bhature from market.


6. Bread with butterand /or Jam.

But do you know what is the typical breakfast of most students living outside their hometown pursuing professional courses.

This


With


And lot of paranthas every day.

(Due to this we have too many smokers having professional degree.)

Now my breakfast alternatives are

1.Oats cooked in milk with dry fruits (sort of oat kheer).During winters add 2 boiled egg with oats.

2. Glass of cow’s milk with 2 whole egg and 3 egg white.

3. Now days I am eating simple plain roties with a glass of cow's milk.

My wife eats

1.Oats with vegetables in it.

2.Plain roties with vegetable.

On Sundays we eat

1.Macroni with cheese and different sauces.

2.Great sandwiches prepared by wife.

3.Parathas
For a typical Telugu guy like me, in an urban middle class family, this is what the breakfast would be in a standard Andhra household.

In my place though the more common word is Tiffins, be it Hyderabad or any other city or town in Andhra Pradesh. And bachelors, students usually have their breakfast at a Tiffin center.


Idli or Idli with Vada, and a combination of coconut chutney and sambhar, is a standard staple. In fact if you want to have a breakfast that is not too oily, Idly is the best option. While idlies are usually eaten with chutney/sambhar, you could try some other combos, my favorite as a kid, ghee/sugar.


Pesarattu a more crispy Dosa kind, made with moong dal only, you have a variation of this Upma Pesarattu, where it is served with upma, popular in coastal Andhra.


The standard Dosa, that can be eaten with pickle, sugar, sometimes just like that, jam, ketchup, your choice.


The Masala Dosa, you don't really need chutney for it, those alu fillings r more than enough.


Rava Dosa, variant of Dosa more crispier, made out of Rava, best eaten with chutney.


Upma is tasty, healthy, nutritious. Again like Idli if you are seeking a breakfast that is not too heavy or oily this is the best choice.


Aloo Puri, again quite a common breakfast, though tends to be more oily.

Apart from this bread and jam, Maggi 2 minute noodles are also quite common in most households for breakfast.
Whatever we eats, it should be healthy and satisfies our hunger. Let’s see what do people eat for breakfast, according to states:

Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Kerala & Telangana


Dosa, Idli, Vada, Bonda, Upma, Puri, Uthappam, ragi mudde, lemon rice. These are some dishes which are popular and daily eatables in south India. We people just love these. Along with these all, the super famous chutney comes along which we eat by mixing up.

On ending note, i’m happy to talk about my favorite Tea. No matter what we eat; breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks, we most of the Indians love it.

I am from West Bengal.

In this region, the famous breakfast among bengalis is Luchi and Aaloor dam. In weekend or any special time like when we celebrate our birthdays , any puja (festival) or any occasion we prefer luchi, aaloor dam and misti (sweet) specially rosogolla.



we also eat ruti ( made of wheat) and tarkari ( made of vegetables) in weekdays. This dish is very light and healthy.


In some part of North Kolkata and the adjoining areas people eat muri (puffed rice) with televaja ( fried brinjal /mashed potato / onion etc). Jilebi is also our favourite snack.



Kachuri and chholar dal is also famous in some areas.


The areas which are comparatively hot in summer, people usually eat “pantha vat” ( rice with water) with mashed potato, green chilis and onion for breakfast . It hepls to cool down their body temparature and hydrates their body.
The breakfast is eaten like a king India and it is one of the elaborate meals that the Indians take except some people who really fall short of time to cook:

Parthas (Shallow fried unleavened bread )with dahi (yogurt):

There are as many varieties of parthas as you can think of muli, gobi, aloo, methi, bathua (various veggies) and even lentils are used for paratha stuffing. All veggies, lentils and flour make them a healthy meal. Plus, they are served hot with curd and pickles and hence taste like heaven.


Halwa:

It is a sweet delicacy that also have many varieties gajar (carrot) ka halwa, sooji (semolina) ka halwa, moong ki dal ka halwa, aate ka halwa etc. ) it is served with a glass of milk or coffee. See how this breakfast looks like.


Partha or poori subji:

The unleavened bread either deep (poori) or shallow fried (parathas) taken along with cooked veggies. Here we go with the pic of it.


Dosa/Idli/Vada With Sambhar:

Down in the South you will find the shallow fried rice pancakes or steamed puffed pancakes along with sambhar and chutney and it is taken along with coffee. Here is a pic.


There are certain lighter breakfast items also like poha, dhokla or namkeen sewaiyin. They can also be used as evening time snacks. Here how poha looks like.


This is how you fill yourself in the morning when you will be India. When you are in a trip to India expect to find the breakfast of Dahi jalebi or aloo kachoori or bread pakora…..


This is what you expect to eat in the morning when in India. We help you
