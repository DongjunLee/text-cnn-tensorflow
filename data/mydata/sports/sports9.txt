Spain international Jordi Alba has played 282 games for Barcelona since re-joining from Valencia in 2012 after being released by the club as a teenager, winning 14 trophies including four La Liga titles, four Copa del Reys and the 2015 Champions League.

Alba, 29, has been capped 67 times by Spain and was part of the side that won the 2012 European Championship.

The full back has grown in importance to the team since Ernesto Valverde took over as coach in 2017 and has a good understanding with Lionel Messi, providing 20 assists for the Argentine forward.
