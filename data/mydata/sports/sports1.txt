IPL 2019, KXIP vs CSK Live Cricket Score Streaming Online Today Match Updates: Kings XI Punjab play their final home game against CSK with slim chances of qualifying for playoffs.
IPL 2019, KXIP vs CSK Live Cricket Match Score Online: Chennai Super Kings are already through to the playoffs and Kings XI Punjab, on the other hand, are all but out of contention. KXIP can still qualify if they get a huge, huge win and KKR fail to win. The outcome of this contest, however, is also important in the context of whether CSK finish top of the points table or not. A win for them may just be good enough for the top spot, irrespective of the outcome between MI and KKR.

CSK need to fine tune their batting at this stage in the tournament if they are to retain their title. Bar MS Dhoni, none of the other batsmen have been consistent enough and that is a cause for concern heading into playoffs.
